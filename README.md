# Dotnet Angular

This project is an experiment to try out a .NET/C# front end with an Angular/TypeScript front end. It's *extremely* minimal since it's just for practice using this tech stack.

You'll see the name "Photos" throughout the project because the example I had in mind when I was building it was a photo viewer similar to Apple's or Google's photos apps.
